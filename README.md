date started: 21/12/2023


idea:
Archery game that utilises the competitiveness of the sport and works as a way to see who can get more points in a set amount of time




TODO:
- [✅] Make a MENU
- [ ] Add settings?
- [✅] Add quit button
- [ ] Create the game:
- - [ ] Scoring system
- - [ ] Arrow physics
- - [ ] Stamina/Hold bar (since holding a strung bow is tiresome)
- - [ ] Timer
- - [ ] Graphics
- - [ ] X and Y axis shot
- - [ ] hit animations?









Captain log:
1. created a repo, made a run.py file, got the pygame lib
2. created a menu that changes displays between: "start game", "settings", "quit"
3. created buttons file that is responsible for: initialising buttons, updating buttons, detecting inputs, changing color on hover for visual clarity.
4. added custom font
5. added images, however, they require fixing, due to resolution issues. Need to make my own.
